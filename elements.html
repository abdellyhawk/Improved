            <h3 class="major">motherboard</h3>
            <p>
              A motherboard is the central circuit board in a computer or electronic device that connects and integrates
              various hardware components, allowing them to communicate and work together. It serves as the foundation
              for the entire system, providing connections for the CPU, RAM, storage drives, expansion cards, and
              peripherals. The motherboard is like the nervous system of a computer, coordinating the interactions
              between different parts to ensure smooth operation and functionality. </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>CPU</h3>
            <p>The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the primary component in a computer responsible for executing
              instructions and performing calculations. Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, the CPU
              carries out tasks by processing data and executing instructions from programs and applications. It
              performs essential functions such as arithmetic operations, logic operations, and data movement. In
              summary, the CPU is the core component that drives the computational power and performance of a computer
              system.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>RAM</h3>

            RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of volatile memory in a computer that temporarily stores data and
            instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. Unlike permanent storage devices such as hard disk drives
            (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs), which retain data even when the power is turned off, RAM loses its
            contents when the computer is shut down. RAM serves as a high-speed workspace for the CPU, allowing it to
            efficiently access and manipulate data required for running applications and executing tasks. The more RAM a
            computer has, the more data it can store temporarily, leading to smoother multitasking, faster program
            execution, and overall improved system performance.

            <h3>Storage Drives</h3>
            <p>Storage drives are components in a computer system responsible for storing and retrieving data over the
              long term. They come in various types, such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs). HDDs
              store data on spinning magnetic disks, while SSDs use flash memory for faster access times. The primary
              purpose of storage drives is to provide a permanent repository for files, documents, programs, and the
              operating system. Users can save and access data from these drives even when the computer is turned off.
              Storage drives play a crucial role in maintaining the user's data and ensuring that it remains accessible
              for future use.</p>

            <h3>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h3>
            <p>
              The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is a component in a computer that converts electrical power from an outlet
              into usable power for the computer's components. Its primary purpose is to provide consistent and reliable
              power to the motherboard, CPU, drives, and other peripherals. The PSU ensures that each component receives
              the appropriate voltage and current to function correctly. It also regulates and distributes power
              efficiently to prevent damage caused by voltage fluctuations or electrical surges. In summary, the PSU is
              essential for supplying the necessary electricity to power all the internal components of a computer
              system.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>GPU</h3>
            <p>The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized processor designed to handle graphical computations
              efficiently. Its primary purpose is to render and display images, videos, and graphical content on a
              computer monitor or other display devices. Unlike the CPU, which focuses on general-purpose computing
              tasks, the GPU excels at parallel processing and is optimized for tasks such as 3D rendering, video
              editing, and gaming graphics. GPUs accelerate graphical tasks by offloading them from the CPU, resulting
              in smoother performance and enhanced visual quality. In addition to powering graphics-intensive
              applications, modern GPUs also support technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and
              parallel computing, making them versatile components in various computing environments.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Cooling system</h3>
            <p>
              The Cooling System in a computer is responsible for maintaining optimal operating temperatures for its
              components. Its primary purpose is to dissipate heat generated by the CPU, GPU, and other high-performance
              parts to prevent overheating and potential damage. The Cooling System typically includes fans, heat sinks,
              and sometimes liquid cooling solutions. These components work together to circulate air or coolant
              throughout the computer, transferring heat away from critical components and expelling it out of the
              system. By keeping temperatures within safe limits, the Cooling System ensures stable performance and
              prolongs the lifespan of the hardware. Efficient cooling also enables overclocking, allowing users to push
              their components beyond their stock performance levels for increased speed and power.</p>
